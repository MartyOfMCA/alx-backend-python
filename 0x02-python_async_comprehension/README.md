# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension
This directory contains Python scripts on Async Comprehension. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Asynchronous programming in Python using asyncio
* Asynchronous Comprehensions
* Asynchronous Generators
* Type-Annotating Generators

## How to run
All scripts have been marked as executables and can easily be executed using the syntax:

`./script.py`
