# 0x01. Python - Async
This directory contains Python scripts on asynchronous programming in Python. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Asynchronous programming
* `asyncio` package
* Coroutines using `async` & `await`
* The `random` module

## How to run
All scripts have been marked as executables and can easily be executed using the syntax:

`./script.py`
