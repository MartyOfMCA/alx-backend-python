# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
This directory contains Python scripts on variable annotations. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Type annotations
* Duck typing

## How to run
All scripts have been marked as executables and can easily be executed using the syntax:

`./script.py`
